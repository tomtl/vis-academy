# Kepler GL
Building Kepler GL using the lessons and classes from the Uber visualization team, focusing on the visualizations frameworks that Uber built:

* [deck.gl](http://deck.gl) - for large-scale WebGL visualizations;
* [react-map-gl](https://uber.github.io/react-map-gl/) - React components for Mapbox GL;
* [react-vis](https://uber.github.io/react-vis/) - A composable React charting library

Forked from https://github.com/uber-common/vis-academy
